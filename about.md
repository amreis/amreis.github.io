Hi, I'm Alister Machado dos Reis, a 24-years old Google Software Engineer from Porto Alegre, Brazil, currently living in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science ([Institute of Informatics](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/)) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial)) in March 2018.
I was also part of the BRAFITEC exchange program between the years of 2015 and 2017. It is one of the most competitive exchange programs of my country.

As a part of this program, I was also enrolled at the INP Grenoble (Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble) in Grenoble, France. There, I was a student at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique et Mathématiques Apliquées de Grenoble (ENSIMAG). I was enrolled as an Information Systems Engineering student between 2015 and 2016, and later I was a student in the Master's Program in Data Science (2016-2017).

You can find my Master's Thesis online here (it has a short introduction in Portuguese, but the main text is in English): [Incremental Learning Applied to Streaming Environments](https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/175067), [PDF](https://lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/175067/001065053.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

My exchange program entails a double degree, which means I have obtained degrees from both the Brazilian and French institutes.

I'm mostly interested in Reinforcement Learning these days, but it wasn't a part of my studies so I'm teaching myself and using these blog posts to build and share knowledge.

You can find me on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/AlisterMachado), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alistermachado/), [Github](https://github.com/amreis/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/porralister), and here is my [Resume](/assets/cv/CV_AlisterReis.pdf).

Hope you enjoy the content!
