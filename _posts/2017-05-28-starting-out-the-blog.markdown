# Hello there, and welcome!

So I was going to keep posting in [dev.to](http://dev.to) directly, but for reasons of math rendering and because I want to have more control over my posts, I finally set this blog up under my Github domain.

The first post is already here, and the second one, now that I have math rendering, will be coming out shortly!

Thanks, and I hope you find the content enjoyable.

PS: Yes, the layout is still a little rough, but I'm gonna improve it over the next few weeks.
